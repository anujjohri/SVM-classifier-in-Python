# SVM-classifier-in-Python

In this example, We are considering that client has given us 2 files, train and test. In which testing data does not have predicted value
 
So our goal is to manually enter that value and submit it to client.
 
 Dataset given to us is small, if we divide our train data to test/validation/train we would be training our model on a further smaller dataset
 
 Here we will be using training dataset entirely to train our model
 
 Thus we will use K- fold validation to check accuracy
